# DiscordAutoReact
This is a Discord self-bot and works in all servers that allow reactions. This self-bot does not need to be invited to the server since it is a self-bot and not a traditional bot. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Install Python

Step 2: Install pynput & pyautogui

Step 3: Open "AutoMouseMover.py"

Step 4: Make sure the emoji you want the bot to react with is in "Frequently Used" (the default emoji for the bot to react with is the "Man DetectiveüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" emoji but this can be changed)

Step 5: Copy the code from "DiscordAutoReactScript.txt" and paste it in the Developer Tools Console (make sure to close "Developer Tools" after you run the code)

Steo 6: Press "t" to make "AutoMouseMover.py" run (it should say "Auto mouse mover is on." in the terminal window)


TIPS:

1: Make sure your Discord window is at full size

2: Make sure you do NOT have stuff like "Developer Tools" or "Show Member List" open

3: If you wanna change the emoji the bot reacts with simply just have the wanted emoji in your "Frequently Used" and go to the "DiscordAutoReactScript.txt" file and replace 'man_detective' with the emoji name

4: Refresh the page to stop reacting
