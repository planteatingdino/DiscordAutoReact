Step 4: Make sure the emoji you want the bot to react with is in "Frequently Used" (the default emoji for the bot to react with is the "Man DetectiveüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" emoji but this can be changed)
Step 4: Copy the code from "DiscordAutoReactScript.txt" and paste it in the Developer Tools Console
Steo 5: Press "t" to make "AutoMouseMover.py" run (it should say "Auto mouse mover is on." in the terminal window)

Tips:

2: Make sure you do NOT have stuff like "Inspect Element" or "Show Member List" open
2: If you wanna change the emoji the bot reacts with simply just have the wanted emoji in your "Frequently Used" and go to the "DiscordAutoReactScript.txt" file and replace 'man_detective' with the emoji name
